    <h1>About HTML</h1>
    <p><b>HyperText Markup Language, commonly known by the acronym HTML, is the most widely used markup language for web documents. Created for the formatting and layout of hypertext documents available in web 1.0, today it is mainly used for the decoupling of the logical structure of a web page (defined precisely by markup) and its representation, managed through CSS styles to adapt to the new needs of communication and publication within the Internet. [3]

        HTML is a public domain language, the syntax of which is established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It is derived from SGML, a metalanguage aimed at defining languages that can be used for the drafting of documents intended for transmission in electronic format. The current version, the fifth, was published by the W3C in October 2014.</b></p>
